HTML2SH is a perl script to convert HTML pages to a StrongHelp manual.

What it can convert:
Simple tags like <B>,<I>,<EM>,<PRE>,<H1> etc.
Links between pages and within that same page
Lists
Alignment
Named characters
Images (Currently it just uses the ALT text)

What it can't do:
Frames
Tables
Image maps
Forms
Broken HTML
Javascript
The cooking
The washing up
Any other fancy stuff

Sometimes it does not get the layout perfect, but it is usually readable.
It is most suitable for converting technical manuals and documentation,
for example the PHP manual.


Using it
~~~~~~~~
Set the Current Selected Directory to the directory containing the HTML
If the file to convert is called index.html then just double click on HTML2SH
Otherwise at the command prompt type
*Run ADFS::4.$.path.HTML2SH filetoconvert
where path is the full pathname to HTML2SH
It will then convert the file, and any files linked to from the file.
You should ensure that the wimpslot is set larger than the largest file to convert.
